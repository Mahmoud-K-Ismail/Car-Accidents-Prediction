# Accidents Predictor Using Ensemble Methods

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict accidents using various ensemble machine learning methods. By leveraging multiple algorithms and combining their predictions, the goal is to enhance the accuracy and robustness of accident predictions. The project utilizes historical accident data to train and evaluate the models, ultimately providing insights into the factors contributing to accidents.

## Features

- **Data Loading**: Retrieves and extracts accident data from an online source.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Reads and prepares datasets for analysis, including accident characteristics, vehicles involved, and user information.
- **Visualization**: Utilizes libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, helping to understand trends and patterns in the data.
- **Ensemble Methods**: Implements ensemble learning techniques to improve prediction accuracy.

## Getting Started

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AccidentsPredictor.git
   cd AccidentsPredictor
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download and Prepare Data**:
   The project automatically downloads the dataset from a specified URL. Simply run the main script to execute this step.

4. **Run the Project**:
   Execute the Python script to train and evaluate the accident prediction models:
   ```bash
   python accidents_predictor.py
   ```

## Data

The project uses datasets available at [Accident Data Source](https://bianchi.wp.imt.fr/files/2023/12/accident.zip). Ensure you have the necessary permissions to use this data.

## Visualizations
